# Calendar_Planner

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to get more familiar using API's, jquery, bootstrap, and localstorage syntax. I learned proper use of (this) function and I practiced manipulating the HTML within javascript. I learned how to apply CDN scripts and proper use of documentations. Dayjs is one example of the documentations I was using.

## Installation

None needed, just be sure you have the CDN's in your HTML.
